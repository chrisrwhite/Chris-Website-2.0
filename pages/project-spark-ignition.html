            		<h2>Project 4:</h2>
            		<h2>Experimental Analysis of Spark Ignition Performance</h2>

            		<h3>Abstract</h3>

            		<p>The majority of automobiles operate on the four-stroke internal composition (IC) engines in order to transfer chemical energy via a spark ignition (SI) process into mechanical work to drive pistons. Since IC engines produce useful torque over a limited range of crankshaft rotational speeds, automobile engine manufacturers increase engine performance by designing engines that flatten the torque-versus-rotational speed curve in order to have maximum torque between both high and low end speeds without sacrificing power output. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the optimal shaft rotation speed ranges to achieve the maximum engine efficiency for a Briggs & Stratton V-Twin OHV 16 engine by applying simulated parasitic loads via a D-100 Small Engine Dynamometer. Crank shaft angle, torque, shaft speed, and engine cylinder internal pressure were measured for single cycles while applying various fluid loads for the cases of low, middle, and full throttles. This range of loadings was used to explore the effect of parasitic loadings between low and high end torque on the actual engine. The experimental performance of the engine was evaluated based on the torque and power curves and the results were compared to published data from manufacturer [3]. The low throttle case achieved an optimal mechanical efficiency of 65.0&#177;1.73% at 1200 RPM. The middle throttle had the highest mechanical efficiency of 79.5&#177;0.83% at 1830 RPM. The full throttle case achieved an efficiency of 81.8&#177;1.13% at 1770 RPM.</p>


            		<h3>Introduction and Methods</h3>
            		<p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that the nominal price of petroleum will be $2.73 per gallon by 2016 as a result of the increasing trend present since 1998, when petroleum was $1.03 per gallon [1]. The automotive industry is severely impacted by the increase in fuel price coupled with the uncertainty of the Earth‚Äôs fossil fuel reserves. According to the law of conservation of energy, designing an engine of higher efficiency results in both environmental and economic incentives, since more energy is extracted from the fuel. This can be accomplished by maximizing the torque while holding it constant between low and high end speeds. In order to test and analyze a prototype IC engine, the Otto cycle is used to represent the actual four-stroke cycle as an idealized thermodynamic cycle with no internal irreversibilities and is illustrated in Figure 1a. Since the Otto cycle is executed in a closed system, it can be analyzed using the energy balance equation, expressed as</p>

            </h4>












            <p>The Otto cycle consists of a total of 6 processes, resulting in the crankshaft rotating a 720 Ãä per complete cycle. It begins with process 6-1 as a fuel-air mixture is drawn into the engine cylinder isobarically as the piston travels from top dead center (TDC) to bottom dead center (BDC), resulting in an increase in the cylinder volume. The mixture is then isentropically compressed in process 1-2 as the piston travels from BDC to TDC resulting in an increase in the pressure. Heat is transferred isochorically to the mixture in process 2-3 via ignition from spark plug found in SI engines. The fuel- air mixture expands in the cylinder performing work on the piston isentropically during the power stroke in process 3-4, driving the piston from TDC to BDC. Heat is rejected isochorically from the engine in process 4-5 at BDC. The mass of spent fuel is expelled from the engine to the environment in process 5-6 through the exhaust stroke and the entire cycle repeats. Each of the processes in the Otto cycle can be thermodynamically analyzed using Eq. (1) with the appropriate assumptions in order to determine work and heat transfer. The volume between BDC and TDC represents the displacement volume of the piston and the volume between TDC and the top of the cylinder represents the clearance volume where the combustion of the compressed fuel-air mixture occurs.</p>

            <p>The actual IC four-stroke engine P-V diagram has slight variations compared to the Otto cycle due to the behavior between the piston and the fuel-air mixture, resulting in the production of a certain amount of work per cycle as illustrated in Figure 1b. The work of the piston is determined through the integral of the product between the pressure within the cylinder and the differential cylinder volume, expressed as</p>

<p>where <i>P</i> and <i>ùëâ</i> are the pressure and volume of the cylinder respectively. As illustrated in Figure 1b, the gross work is the positive work is denoted by area A produced by the power stroke due to the interaction between the expanding gas and the piston. The negative work is denoted by area B, which is due to the pump work of the piston required to draw the fuel-air mixture in and expel exhaust. The resultant of the produced and consumed work for the four-stroke cycle is the net work, which determined by subtracting the pump work from the gross work. However the net work of the engine is only the amount of work exerted by the working fluid on the piston and is not the same work outputted by the engine.</p>

<p>Brake work is the available work produced by the engine, measured by the dynamometer and is determined by the product of the torque and the rotational speed of the output shaft. The brake work is less than the net work due to irreversabilities within the system in the form of heat transfer and friction, which are not accounted for by the net work. Therefore the mechanical efficiency is used to evaluate the performance of the engine, expressed as</p>

<p>In the current study, the efficiencies for the compressor, turbine, nozzle, and combustor as well as the CE, ST, TSFC, PM, and PE were experimentally determined for the gas turbine engine at idle, low, middle, and full throttles. The experimental data was compared to the idealized Brayton cycle in order and the theoretical thrust, ST and TSFC to validate the experimental process.</p>

<p>The experiments were performed on an instrumented SR-30 Minilab gas turbine engine while measuring pressure, temperature, shaft rotational speed, fuel flow, and thrust at rotational speeds between 42,493 and 77,067 RPM. The experimental schematic and locations of the instrumentation are illustrated in Figure 3.</p>

<h4>

</h4>


<h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
<p>The following experiments were considered: (1) idle at 42,493 RPM, (2) low throttle at 53,676 RPM, (3) middle throttle at 66,590 RPM, and (4) full throttle at 77,067 RPM.</p>

<p>The operation of the SR-30 Minilab gas turbine engine was initiated according to startup procedure in the Operating Instructions at a laboratory temperature of 25 &deg;C and barometric pressure of 101.4 kPa [3]. For each throttle case, the fuel intake valve was adjusted to the corresponding throttle position, where it remained until the gas turbine reached steady state. Steady state was defined to be when the fluxuations in shaft speed fluctuations were within &#177;50 RPM. The T-s diagrams for the actual land ideal cycles were generated for each throttle case in Figure 4. The efficiencies for the 300 compressor, turbine, nozzle, and combustor were determined as well as the CE, ST, TSFC, PM, and PE for idle, low, middle, and full throttles displayed in Figure 5. The experimentally determined values were compared to the theoretical thrust, ST, and TSFC displayed in Figure 5d.</p>

<h4>

</h4>

<p>The T-s curves for each throttle case are displayed in Figure 4. As
	throttle increases, the temperature at the entrance of the combustor, turbine
	inlet, and increases in respect to throttle, resulting in an increase in the power generated during turbine process. The exhaust region remains consistent for
	each case regardless of throttle position, since these process occurs at constant pressure of atmosphere. The deviations from the Brayton cycle in the actual
	cycle are evident at the compressor and turbine due to irreversabilities in the processes resulting in entropy generation, stagnation pressure decrease in the combustor, and heat transfer from components. Due to the irreversabilites,
	more work is required to drive the compressor than the Brayton cycle. In the experimental setup, a nozzle was used at the entrance in order to accelerate the 700
	air flow entering the engine. In actual jet engines, diffusors are used to slow down air flow. This increases the pressure as well so the compressor requires less work to function. At higher throttles there is a higher pressure and therefore extra work is produced in the turbine and is used by the compressor and other functions in the engine. The less the pressure drop in the turbine, the more pressure available for the nozzle pressure differential resulting in greater thrust.</p>

	</h4>

	<p>Figure 5a shows turbine, compressor, and nozzle efficiencies for each throttle case calculated using Eqs. (2-4). The turbine efficiency drops due to the low mass flow rate at 54,000 RPM, which means the working fluid is not providing enough power to turbine. The turbine efficiency then increases due the higher mass flow rate. Nozzle efficiency increases because the nozzle heats up and become more efficiency at higher temperatures, however at full throttle the efficiency decreases. Since the nozzle heats up, the efficiency was 103% at the middle throttle. Therefore the engine works best at medium throttles. As the loading increases, the rotational speed decreases and the amount of useful power produced increases. The compressor efficiency remains steady, and does not increase drastically throughout the full range of shaft rotational speeds. The efficiecny errors were below 0.003, indicating that the error was insignificant in affecting the result.</p>


	<p>Figure 5b displays combustion efficiency for each case determined using Eq. (5). It is seen that combustion efficiency increases because of the higher mass flow rate of the air entering the engine. Resulting in more overall heat transfer into the working fluid. It can be seen that at low throttles, the combustion efficiency increases at a slow rate until it reaches 54,000 RPM, where the efficiency increases drastically linearly. However the values for combustor efficiency are not correct since they yield unrealistic results.</p>

	<p>Figure 5c displays the CE, PM, and PE determined using Eqs. (6-8). CE increased from low throttle to 66,000 RPM, where it plateaus, displaying that the overall cycle runs optimally at 66,000 RPM. Negative cycle efficiency was displayed at idle because the engine is not self-reciprocating where the turbine can sufficiently drive the compression process. PM decreased from idle to 54,000 RPM because PM is dependent on the efficiency between the turbines shafts connected to the compressor. If the PM was equal to 1 that would mean that all the power generated in the turbine would be completely transferred without losses to the compressor through the shaft. PE remained constant at 6.6¬±0.08%. The reason for why this is so low is because the engine is not moving. In moving engines the propulsive efficiency would be nearly 100% when the thrust is equal to drag force. The errors for each of them were determined to be below 0.1, indicating that the error was insignificant in affecting the results.</p>

	<p>Figure 5d displays the experimental and theoretical thrust and specific thrust for each throttle case determine using Eqs. (9-13) it is displayed that the theoretical thrust and specific thrust predicts that the thrust produced by the engine will be much greater than the actual results. The error for the thrust was determined to be below 0.5395, indicating that the error was insignificant in affecting the results.</p>

	<p>Figure 5e displays the experimental and theoretical TSFC for each throttle case determine using Eqs. (10 & 13) It is displayed that the theoretical TSFC predicts that the thrust produced by the engine will be much greater than the actual results.</p>




	<h3>Conclusions</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this experiment was characterize the performance of the SR-30 Minilab gas turbine engine at various speeds. The largest errors can be attributed to the pressure transducers because they were mounted perpendicular to the flow, which resulted in inaccurate pressure measurements. The experimental results were compared to the theoretical thrust, ST and TSFC. It was determined that the gas turbine engine operated most optimally at the middle throttle case at 66,590 RPM producing a thrust of 41.04&#177;0.42 N.</p>
